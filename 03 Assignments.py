#Multiple Assignments = allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.

#How beginners write
# name = "Zack"
# age = 21
# attractive = True

#How to do Multiple Assignments
#Example 1
name, age, attractive = "Zack", 21, True
print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

#Example 2
#If all same value,
# Spongebob = 30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# Squidward = 30


Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30
print (Spongebob)
print(Patrick)
print(Sandy)
print(Squidward)
#But its a hassle if 1 variable changes value.
